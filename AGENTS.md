# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`gnhf` ("good night, have fun") is a CLI that runs a coding agent in a loop inside a git repo.
The supported-agent roster is owned by the README's [Agents](./README.md#agents) table.
Each successful iteration is a separate commit, normally on a dedicated `gnhf/<slug>` branch; `--current-branch` uses the existing branch instead, and `--push` publishes each successful iteration.
Failure and rollback semantics are owned by the README's [How It Works](./README.md#how-it-works) section.
Target: Node 20+, published to npm as a bundled ESM CLI with optional agent-facing skills under `skills/`.

## Commands

`package.json` scripts are the source of truth for build/test/lint commands; the "Developing" section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) documents them plus single-test invocation, the e2e prior-build requirement, and the CI matrix - keep all CI jobs green. `pnpm test` builds and then runs all tests. Releases are automated via release-please; never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json`.

## Architecture

Entry point is `src/cli.ts`. It parses flags with commander, resolves config, handles stdin/worktree/resume setup, then hands off to the orchestrator. Everything else is plain modules under `src/`.

### Run lifecycle (the critical flow)

1. `cli.ts` decides one of four modes: new branch, resume an existing `gnhf/<slug>` branch, `--current-branch`, or `--worktree` (creates a sibling `<repo>-gnhf-worktrees/<slug>/` checkout). New branch and worktree runs probe numeric suffixes such as `gnhf/<slug>-1` and `<repo>-gnhf-worktrees/<slug>-1/` on collisions; current-branch runs first resume an exact same-prompt `.gnhf/runs/<runId>/` on a clean working tree, otherwise they probe `.gnhf/runs/<runId>-1/` metadata collisions without creating a branch; worktree mode also resumes preserved suffixed worktrees before creating a new one. When resuming with a different prompt, it asks whether to update `prompt.md` and continue the existing run history, start a new branch, or quit; if stdin is piped, that confirmation comes from the controlling terminal before any sleep-prevention re-exec. `setupRun`/`resumeRun` in `src/core/run.ts` create `.gnhf/runs/<runId>/` with `prompt.md`, `notes.md`, `output-schema.json`, `base-commit`, optional `stop-when`, `commit-message`, and `gnhf.log`, and add `.gnhf/runs/` to `.git/info/exclude` so run metadata stays local.
2. `Orchestrator` (`src/core/orchestrator.ts`) is an `EventEmitter` loop. Each iteration: build prompt via `src/templates/iteration-prompt.ts` (injects current `notes.md`), add commit-repair instructions when a prior `git commit` failed, call `agent.run(...)`, then on success `commitAll` + append to `notes.md` and optionally `pushCurrentBranch`; on failure `resetHard` unless a pending commit failure is preserving uncommitted work for repair. The user-visible failure/rollback contract lives in the README's "How It Works"; in code, `commitAll` throws `CommitFailedError`, logs `git:commit:failed`, and records the commit output in `notes.md` so the next iteration can repair the workspace, retryable thrown agent errors increment the backoff streak, and `PermanentAgentError` aborts after rollback with `lastAgentError` set for the renderer. The `RunLimits` object enforces `--max-iterations` (between iterations), `--max-tokens` (mid-iteration via AbortController), `--stop-when` (post-iteration via the agent's `should_fully_stop` output, deferred while a commit failure awaits repair), and `--push` post-success publishing.
3. `Renderer` (`src/renderer.ts` + `src/renderer-diff.ts`) is a cell-based TUI using the alt screen buffer. `cli.ts` enters/exits alt screen around it. The renderer subscribes to orchestrator events, diffs frames to minimize writes, and updates the terminal title live. `MockOrchestrator` (`src/mock-orchestrator.ts`) drives the renderer offline via `--mock` for demos/testing.
4. Shutdown path: `SIGINT` routes through `orchestrator.handleInterrupt()`. The first press requests a graceful stop, letting the current iteration finish or ending backoff early; the second press force-stops via `orchestrator.stop()`. `SIGTERM` force-stops immediately. `cli.ts` only keeps the done screen open for aborted runs; graceful stops exit once shutdown cleanup finishes. If it's a `--worktree` run with zero commits and no pending commit failure, the worktree is removed; otherwise it's preserved and the path is printed. After cleanup, `cli.ts` collects final branch/diff stats via `src/core/git.ts` and writes the permanent stdout summary rendered by `src/core/exit-summary.ts`, including an uncommitted-work warning when a commit failure is still pending.

### Agents (`src/core/agents/`)

Each agent implements the `Agent` interface in `types.ts` (`name`, async `run(prompt, cwd, options)` returning `{ output, usage }`, optional `close()`). They share two responsibilities: stream stdout, extract a structured `AgentOutput` (`success`, `summary`, `key_changes_made`, `key_learnings`, commit-message fields when configured, plus `should_fully_stop` only when `--stop-when` is active) that matches the schema built by `buildAgentOutputSchema(...)`, and accumulate `TokenUsage`. `factory.ts` picks one based on config.

- `claude.ts` / `codex.ts` / `copilot.ts` / `pi.ts`: spawn the CLI per iteration in non-interactive mode. Codex uses `--output-schema` pointing at the run's schema file; Claude uses `--json-schema`, treats the last successful structured result as terminal, raises `PermanentAgentError` for low credit balance exits, and after a short grace period shuts down a lingering Claude process tree if it stays alive. Copilot uses JSONL output plus prompt-level schema instructions, then parses the final `assistant.message` content. Pi runs in JSON mode, appends the final output schema to the prompt, and parses the assistant JSON reply from Pi's streamed events.
- `rovodev.ts` / `opencode.ts`: long-running local HTTP servers managed via `managed-process.ts` (start once, reuse across iterations, close on shutdown). OpenCode creates a per-run session and applies a blanket allow rule to avoid prompt blocking.
- `acp.ts`: handles `acp:<target-or-command>` specs through the bundled `acpx` runtime and registry. It keeps a persistent per-run session keyed by run ID under `.gnhf/runs/<runId>/acp-sessions`, embeds the output schema in the prompt, parses only output text deltas as final JSON, records ACP lifecycle events in `gnhf.log`, and reports per-iteration token usage from ACP `used` deltas when available with prompt-length plus tool-call estimates as a fallback. Estimated ACP usage is marked for the renderer so totals are prefixed with `~`. Path and arg overrides are native-agent-only; ACP targets are customized via `acpRegistryOverrides` in config (a target-name -> spawn-command map fed into acpx's agent registry) or by passing a raw ACP server command directly after `acp:`. Raw command specs are redacted to `acp:custom`/`custom` in debug logs, errors, and telemetry. The e2e suite exercises the full wire path against the `acp-mock` package registered through that same override mechanism.
- `json-extract.ts`: shared recovery for final agent JSON that may be fenced or prose-wrapped; use it before adding ad-hoc parsing to integrations that must validate output against the agent schema.
- `stream-utils.ts`: shared JSONL parsing, `AbortSignal` wiring, and child-process lifecycle helpers. When touching agent streaming, start here.

Reserved args managed by gnhf are rejected in `config.ts` via `isReservedAgentArg` - if you add a new flag that gnhf controls, add it to that list so user overrides can't shadow it.

### Config (`src/core/config.ts`)

Loads `~/.gnhf/config.yml` (bootstrapped on first run). CLI flags override config; runtime-only flags (`--max-iterations`, `--max-tokens`, `--stop-when`) are never persisted to config. `--stop-when` is persisted per run for resume. `agent` accepts native agent names plus `acp:<target-or-command>` specs; `agentPathOverride` and `agentArgsOverride` are native-agent-only, and paths resolve relative to `~/.gnhf/` with `~` expansion. `acpRegistryOverrides` maps ACP target names to spawn commands, threaded into acpx's agent registry so `acp:<name>` resolves against the override map first - useful for pinning a custom or local build of an ACP agent while keeping logs/telemetry on the named target. Raw ACP command specs can also be passed directly and are logged as `acp:custom`. `commitMessage.preset: conventional` adds commit-message fields to the output schema/prompt and changes successful-iteration commit subjects; the resolved convention is persisted per run so resume does not silently switch formats after config changes.

### Git helpers (`src/core/git.ts`)

All git invocations go through `execFileSync` with explicit argv. `git.injection.test.ts` guards against shell-metachar leakage via branch names and prompts - add a case there whenever you accept new user input that flows into git args.

### Sleep prevention (`src/core/sleep.ts`)

When `preventSleep` is on and the process wasn't already re-exec'd under a sleep-inhibitor, gnhf re-execs itself under `caffeinate` (macOS), `systemd-inhibit` (Linux), or a PowerShell `SetThreadExecutionState` helper (Windows). The re-exec uses `GNHF_SLEEP_INHIBITED=1` as the loop-breaker and `GNHF_REEXEC_STDIN_PROMPT_FILE` to pass piped stdin across the re-exec (the original process writes a 0600 temp file, the child reads and unlinks it).

### Telemetry (`src/core/telemetry.ts`)

Anonymous run summaries POSTed to a self-hosted Umami instance.
One pageview at run start and one `track("run", ...)` event at the end - never per-iteration, and never with `cwd`, branch slug, prompt content, or anything else that could identify a user or repo.
Build-time defaults are injected via `tsdown.config.ts`'s `define` from `GNHF_UMAMI_HOST` / `GNHF_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`; runtime env vars of the same name override, and `GNHF_TELEMETRY=0|false|off` disables.
**User-facing docs about telemetry must stay minimal: cover only the opt-out env var (`GNHF_TELEMETRY=0`) and that the data is anonymous. Do not document fields, endpoint, or build-time injection in the README.**

## Conventions

- ESM-only, `.js` import extensions in TypeScript source (`import { foo } from "./foo.js"`). tsdown bundles it all into `dist/cli.mjs`.
- Unit tests co-located as `*.test.ts`; e2e tests under `e2e/`. Prefer e2e (new or existing) for behavior that crosses a process/IO boundary - CLI flags, config loading, git, agent spawning, stdout - since these match how the product is actually used and have proven less brittle than mock-heavy unit tests in this codebase. Unit-test pure helpers (schema builders, prompt templates, formatters) where speed and failure localization are worth more than realism. Use TDD for bugfixes and new features.
- Error paths matter - `debug-log.ts` writes JSONL lifecycle events to `.gnhf/runs/<id>/gnhf.log` with full `error.cause` chains. Prefer `appendDebugLog("category:event", {...})` over ad-hoc logging.
- No em dashes ("-"). No auto-added Claude co-author lines in commits.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
